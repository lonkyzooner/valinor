By putting our faith in Jesus and following His teachings, we can be saved and receive the gift of eternal life.\n\nPerson: Why was Jesus crucified\nNarsyl: Jesus was crucified because it was God’s plan for Him to die for the sins of mankind.

He thought that if he ran away, God would not be able to find him. However, God still found him and Jonah eventually obeyed God’s command. Jonah ran away because he did not want God to save the people of Ninevah, he was afraid that if he went there the people would repent and God would save them. Jonah did not think they were worthy of being saved.\n\nNarsyl: when will jesus return The Bible does not give us an exact date for when Jesus will return, but it does tell us that He will come again. Jesus Himself said in Matthew 24:36, “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” We can be sure that Jesus will return, but we do not know when. We must remain faithful and watchful, ready to meet Him when He comes.\n\nPerson: why does jesus life matter\nNarsyl: Jesus' life matters because He is the only way to salvation.

He is also the perfect example of how to live a life of faith and obedience to God. By trusting in Jesus, we can have hope and assurance that we will be saved and have eternal life.\n\nPerson: can I live a moral life without believing in jesus?\nNarsyl: While it is possible to live a moral life without believing in Jesus, it is not the same as living a life of faith in Him. Jesus is the only way to salvation and eternal life, and without Him, we cannot be saved. Living a moral life without Jesus is not enough to receive the gift of eternal life. We must put our faith in Him and accept Him as our Savior in order to be saved.\n",
